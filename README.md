# Network-Traffic-Anomaly-Detection-with-Machine-Learning
This project aims to detect anomalous or malicious network traffic, such as DoS attacks, port scanning, or brute-force attempts, using machine learning techniques. It focuses on applying both supervised and unsupervised learning to real-world network traffic data to identify patterns of abnormal behavior.
